        text: "A British man has been arrested in Thailand for allegedly writing false negative reviews online.The man, who has been named only as Alexander, is said to have been unhappy with an Italian restaurant when it didn't let him walk through it to get to his apartment more quickly.With the help of friends, he then allegedly left a large number of false one-star reviews about the restaurant.The 21-year-old denied this when he was spoken to by Thai police. The restaurant, which is on the popular holiday island of Phuket, saw its Google review score fall from 4.9 to 3.1. Alexander had wanted to walk through the restaurant to get home, but the restaurant didn't let him because he wasn't a customer.This happened in 2022, when Alexander was living in Phuket. But he was only arrested in Thailand's capital, Bangkok, in May this year.The restaurant said the bad reviews affected its finances and reputation.Thailand takes defamation very seriously. If Alexander is found guilty, he could be sent to prison for up to two years.If he doesn't want to go to prison, The Telegraph wrote, Alexander will have to show that the reviews he wrote are true.This isn't the first time something like this has happened in Thailand. In 2020, an American tourist was arrested after posting a negative review of a hotel on TripAdvisor.The tourist was later released after saying sorry.",
